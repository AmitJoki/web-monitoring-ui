# web-monitoring-ui

This repository is part of the EDGI [Web Monitoring Project](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring).

This component works with [web-monitoring-db](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db) and [web-monitoring-processing](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-processing) to support the next web monitoring workflow.

See [the versionista outputter repo](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/versionista-outputter) and the [version tracking ui](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/version-tracking-ui) repos for earlier work that has some overlap/similar goals.
